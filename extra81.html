		<h1>The History of the Ford Mustang</h1>
		<h2>The greatest American Autmobile</h2>
		<div>
            <p>In the 1960's, Lee Lacoca, VP and GM of ford, envisioned a sporty youth-market car based on the compact Falcon.
                Developed in record time on a shoe-string budget, Ford introduced the '65 Mustang at the World's Fair on April 17th, 1964.
                Ford Planned for 100,000 first-years sales, but dealers sold 22,000 on the first day.
                Ford Mustand launched a whole new genre of automobiles, know as pony cars.
                Ford mareketed the original Mustang as a '65 model, though Ford made several production changes to cars built after August 1964,
                by which time Ford had already sold 120,000.

        <div class="hide">
            <p>Hobbyists refer to the early Mustangs as 64.5's models, while post August cars are late '65's.
                The Mustang launched with convertible and notchback body styles, with the fastback joining the line up as late '65.
                A plethora of options enabled buyers to configure their Mustang as anything from economical runabouts to a weekend race car.
                Total sales for the '65 model was 681,100 nearly seven times Ford's projections.
                The original lineup consisted of a 170-cod straight 6, 4.3 lt V8, and the legendary 289-cod V-8 with up to 300hp.

		<h2>The Mustang grows</h2>
		<div>
            <p><strong>'67 major changes</strong>
            The year '67 saw the first major changes to the Mustang.
        The car grew in length, width, and weight, primarily to allow the installation of a big block motor.
    The 390-cod V-8 in its 6.4 lt configuration produced 335 hp, displace the 289 as the top performer.
Interior and exterior trim was revised, and a new 302-cod V-8 replaced the high horsepower 289's.
For drag racing, Ford offered a 438-cod Cobra Jet V-8 rated at 335 hp and 440lb-ft torque.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="hide">
			<p><strong>The Shelby Mustangs</strong>
            Ford worked with Carroll Shelby to develop a high-performance version, shipping new Mustangs to Shely American for Modifications.
        the '65-'66 Shelby GT350 had a modified 289 rated at 307 HP, as well as impvoed suspension and brakes.
    There was a race-ready GT350R verison and a special version for the Hertza rental car agency, the '66 GT350H.
In '67, as Ford began to exert more control over the production of Shelby cars, the GT500 was produced, powered by a 335 hp 437-cod V-8 fitted with four-barrel carbs.
For '68 the GT450 switch to a 250 hp, 302 V-8, while the GT500 used the 428 Cobra Jet.</p>

		<h2>Mustang Highlights</h2>
		<div>
            <p>What are some of the features of the Mustang that makes it stand our from other pony cars of it's era?</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The Mustang was reportedly named for the World War II fighter plane, not the horse. Other names under consideration included Cougar and T-Bird II (a suggestion from Henry Ford II). The car nearly went to market as the Torino, with ad campaigns already prepared, but consumer surveys showed Mustang to be a better name.</li> 
				<li>In Germany, the Mustang name was in use on a heavy-duty truck built by Krupp. As a result, the first-gen Mustang was exported to Europe as the Ford T-5, which was the internal project name.</li>
				<li>Ford Performance worked on a mid-engine Mustang prototype in the late 1960s.</li>
                <li>In the early 1980s, with demand dropping, Ford considered moving the Mustang to a front-wheel-drive platform shared with Japanese partner Mazda. The car was developed, but instead of replacing the Mustang, it was marketed as the Ford Probe.</li>
                <li>The vaunted "5.0" Mustang V-8 from the Mustang II and Fox eras displaced 302 cubic inches, which translates to 4.9 liters. Ford presumably used the 5.0 label to match the 305-cid V-8 employed by the Chevrolet Camaro starting in 1976, which actually did displace 5.0 liters.</li>

			</ul>

			<p>As you can see, the Ford Mustang is the greatest American Autmobile sports car ever made.</p>
